## Introduction
Bitcoin trading networks are complex and can be susceptible to fraudulent activities. This project provides an analytical approach to rate and verify the trustworthiness of these networks.

## Dataset
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of Bitcoin transactions, encompassing various metrics that contribute to a network's trust evaluation.

## Goodness and Fairness
Our analysis includes a fairness algorithm that ensures ratings are not biased by the network's size or transaction volume.

## Fraud Analysis
We apply statistical and machine learning models to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior within the networks.

## Time Trends
Our time trend analysis assists in identifying dormant or fraudulent nodes at an early stage by observing transaction patterns over time.

## Future Impact
Maintaining platform integrity is crucial. Our proposed future strategies involve the continuous monitoring and immediate response to fraudulent nodes.

## Future Work
The project concludes with a neutral average rating for networks, with a mode rating of 1. We suggest employing assortativity in future work to detect fraudulent networks and promote genuine ones.
